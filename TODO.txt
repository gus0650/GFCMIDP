TODO

i could not get VSCode to compile all classes at once, so there may be bugs that i am not aware of

default font is missing and loading is not fully implemented

inputs from keyboard and mouse are not processed
 hierzu gab es in GFC2.1 diverse "PreProcessed" methoden
 es betrifft insbes
   InputListener
   TextBox
   ...

add gamepad support

issue: everything is very blurry in fullscreen mode
  perhaps Graphic2D can somehow help
  work on TestFullscreen.java to try and fix it

write more TestMIDlets to test the Widgets

search for TODO in the code... and implement/fix

javax.microedition.media is not implemented at all
