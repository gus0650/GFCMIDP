<code>javax.microedition.lcdui</code> replacement.<p>

This package contains classes that are API compatible with those that come
with MIDP.<p>

However, in contrast to the original classes, our implementation 
offers some additional features:
<ul>
	<li>customizable look (fonts, colors...)
	<li>platform independent (runs in an Applet context, on PocketPC etc.)
	<li>layout will look 100% identical accross all platforms 
	(different Handsets, Applet etc.), because BitmapFont is used 
	instead of system fonts.
</ul>
